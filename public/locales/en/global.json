        "about-text": "The quartet was formed in 2022, comprising Martina Greiner, Federico GÃ³mez, Ignacio Santos, and Emilio Cossani, who share a rich background marked by their passion for tango.\n\nTheir union was born out of a desire to be part of the cultural movement of 21st-century Tango, known as the New Golden Age, where the creation of new works takes center stage. Thus, they avoid the repetition of classics and open the door to innovative music and lyrics.\n\nBuenos Aires, a vibrant and chaotic city, reflects the critical moment Argentina (and the world?) is experiencing. In this environment, various forms of interaction inspire the musical creation of this quartet.\n\nTheir unconventional instrumentation within the genre adds fresh textures to tradition, aligning with the purpose of popular music: to capture the present authentically.\n\nAfter a successful tour in Europe in 2024, the quartet is now dedicated to creating new material, which they will present in Buenos Aires and, next year, in various concert halls and milongas across Europe.",
